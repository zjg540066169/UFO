Comment: 
According to the graph above, we can see that most of the data come from the United Statesa and some of them come from Canada. Australia and the United Kingdom contributed very little amount of data.

## line plot showing the number of UFO observed across time among countries

  )


```
Comment: 
In this plot, we can see that for the United States the earliest data happens before 1925 and sometime after 1960 the amount of UFO sighting begins to increase. We can also see that most of UFO sighting reports taken place around 1990 and after. Similar trend for Canada, but the amount of them is not as much as the United States.

    title = "Boxplot showing distribution of the UFO Shape Observed in US ",

  )
```
Comment: 
According to this plot, we can see that the light UFO shape was sighted most often, and the changed shape was the least often according to their medium value. Some of the most common sighted UFO shapes are light, trianle, circle, unknown, other, and fireball, disk, and sphere. Some of the least common sighted UFO shapes are changed crescent, delta, flare, hezagon, pyramid and round.
