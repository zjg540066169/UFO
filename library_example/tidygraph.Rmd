```{r set up, include = FALSE}
# knitr will run the chunk but not include the chunk in the final document
# copy from Jeff

# install dependency
try(source("../dependencies.R"), silent = TRUE)

# ensure reproductivity
set.seed(10)

# load library

library(viridis)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  # display the code in the code truck above its results in the final document
  echo = TRUE,
  # do not display any warning messages generated by the code
  warning = FALSE,
  # set the figure to be 8 x 6, and the proportion it takes to be 90%
  fig.width = 8,
  fig.height = 6, 
  out.width = "90%"
)

# setting a global options for continuous data color family and a different format to set discrete data to have a color family
options(
  ggplot2.countinuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.countinuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d

# have a minimal theme and legends at the bottom
theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
```

## Tidygraph

Test tidygraph 

```{r test}
play_erdos_renyi(10, 0.5) %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  mutate(degree = centrality_degree()) %>% 
  activate(edges) %>% 
  mutate(centrality = centrality_edge_betweenness()) %>% 
  arrange(centrality)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
