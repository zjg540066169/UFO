## Tentative project title

What?\!\! You said there was an UFO???

## Motivation for this project

We are instantly drawn to the UFO dataset and would like to explore
through data to deliver a rigorous and interesting analysis on the data
to answer several questions that might spark.

## Intended final products

We are interested to find out whether there is any relationship between
state and UFOâ€™s. For example, whether all states share the same
probability of sighting an UFO and what kind of UFO. For another
example, we can test whether for each state each year, the average times
of sighting an UFO are roughly the same.

## Anticipated data sources

## Planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

Our team is trying to attack the problem with multiple angles. For
starters, we are going to tidy data and visualize data. We are
interetsed in demostrate the data geographically as a highlight of the
visualization. The next step is to find two interesting questions to be
answered for the dataset and then we would like to perform two analysis
to provide some insight for each, such as regression for the continuous
data portion and a categorical analysis for the categorical data part.
The continuous data part, we would like to conduct an ANOVA test on year
and sighting time for each state. The third part, which is an attempt to
make our project to be meaningful and practical, we are currently
interested in making a prediction or perform an outlier detection for
the dataset depending on which question we will ask in the project.
