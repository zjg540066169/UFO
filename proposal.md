## Tentative project title

## Motivation for this project

## Intended final products

## Anticipated data sources

## Planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

Our team is trying to attack the problem with multiple angles. For
starters, we are going to tidy data and visualize data. We are
interetsed in demostrate the data geographically as a highlight of the
visualization. The next step is to find two interesting questions to be
answered for the dataset and then we would like to perform two analysis
to provide some insight for each, such as regression for the continuous
data portion and a categorical analysis for the categorical data part.
The third part, which is an attempt to make our project to be meaningful
and practical, we are currently interested in making a prediction or
perform an outlier detection for the dataset depending on which question
we will ask in the project.
